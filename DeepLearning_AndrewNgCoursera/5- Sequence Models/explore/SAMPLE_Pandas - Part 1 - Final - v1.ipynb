    "Originally developed by researchers and engineers from the Google Brain team, [**TensorFlow**](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a very powerful open source library for high performance numerical computation. It is built using highly optimized C++ code and computational graph arhcitecture (which we will cover shortly), allowing for high performance speeds and efficient paraliization that make it extrmely well suited for large scale machine learning applications. Tensorflow has quickly become to tool of choice for many machine learning and deep learning engineers, and is the backbone for popular high level neural network APIs like Keras. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons tensorflow has become as popular as it is today, but the most important of these is probably the ease with which operations can be parellelized and distributed across multiple CPU or GPUs. This allows the model developer to train massive neural networks (which can have million of parameters) on humongous training sets in a reasonable amount of time by splitting the computations across hundreds of servers."

    "\n",
    "Tensorflow's fundemental architecture is based on a certain type of computational abstraction known as a “computation graph”. A copmutational graph, or dataflow graph, essentially represents the computations the user defines in terms of the dependencies between individual tensorflow operations (often called 'ops'). A dataflow graph is composed of two main compoenents:\n",
    "- 1) **Nodes:** these represent units of computation and are typically stored as a set of `tf.Operation` objects (which are basically mathematical operations)\n",
    "- 2) **Edges:** these represent the data consumed or produced by a computation (the input or output of a tf.Operation), and are stored as `tf.Tensor` objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a TensorFlow graph, the `tf.matmul` operation would correspond to a single node with two incoming edges (the matrices to be multiplied) and one outgoing edge (the result of the multiplication). The image below represents the graph of a very simple feedforward neural network (which we will cover shortly).  \n",
    "![](images/c4_m9_p1_tensors_flowing.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, nodes and edges make up the overall **Graph structure,** indicating how individual operations are composed together, **but NOT prescribing how they should be used.** The graph structure is like assembly code: inspecting it can convey some useful information, but it does not contain all of the useful context that source code conveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we manipulate Tensorflow with Python, the first thing we do with our Python code is **assemble the computation graph**. Once that is done, the second thing we do is to interact with it (using Tensorflow’s “sessions”, which we will cover shortly). If this sounds confusing, don't worry, it will become clearer once we dive into the code - which we will start doing now! Let's begin by builing a very simple graph. We will start by using three simple operations:\n",
    "- `tf.constant()`: this simply adds a 'constant value' tensor to the graph (a value that does not change)\n",
    "- `tf.variable`: this adds a variable tensor which can be changed based on the calculations in the computation graph (for instance, you would assign the coefficients in a linear regression as a tf.Variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE: It’s important to keep in mind that the computation graph does **NOT live inside of your variables; it lives in the global namespace.** When you assign a tensorflow object to a variable in python, that variable merely becomes a pointer to the tensorflow object in the global namespace. You don't have to worry about this for now, but this becomes an important technical detail when working with complicated models and distributed computing systems.*\n",

In order to make use of the graph, we also need to make a session, which allows us to actually do things; for example, going through the template node-by-node to allocate a bunch of memory for storing computation outputs.

The `tf.add_to_collection` function enables you to associate a list of objects with a **key** (where `tf.GraphKeys` defines some of the standard keys), and `tf.get_collection` enables you to look up all objects associated with a key. Many parts of the TensorFlow library use this facility: for example, when you create a `tf.Variable`, it is added by default to collections representing \"global variables\" and \"trainable variables\". When you later come to create a `tf.train.Saver` or `tf.train.Optimizer`, the variables in these collections are used as the default arguments.\n",

TensorFlow automatically inserts the necessary communication and coordination between devices, making the process fairly straightforward. \n",
    "- **Compilation:** TensorFlow's XLA compiler can use the information in your dataflow graph to generate faster code, for example, by fusing together adjacent operations.\n",
    "- **Portability:** The dataflow graph is a language-independent representation of the code in your model. You can build a dataflow graph in Python, store it in a SavedModel, and restore it in a C++ program for low-latency inference (super fast predictions!).\n"

In this phase, you invoke TensorFlow API functions that construct new tf.Operation (node) and tf.Tensor (edge) objects and add them to a tf.Graph instance. TensorFlow provides a default graph that is an implicit argument to all API functions in the same context. For example:\n",

The tf.Variable object also has methods such as tf.Variable.assign and tf.Variable.assign_add that create tf.Operation objects that, when executed, update the stored value. (See Variables for more information about variables.)\n",

    "Calling tf.train.Optimizer.minimize will add operations and tensors to the default graph that calculates gradients, and return a tf.Operation that, when run, will apply those gradients to a set of variables.\n",

Instead, you compose these functions until you have a tf.Tensor or tf.Operation that represents the overall computation--such as performing one step of gradient descent--and then pass that object to a tf.Session to perform the computation.
