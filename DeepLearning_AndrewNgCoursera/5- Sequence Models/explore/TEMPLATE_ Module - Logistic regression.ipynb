These estimates are then improved by repetitively applying the following two steps:\n",

    "  1. Estimation of logistic regression parameters is typically fairly slow (i.e. - requires much more computational time than is the case of linear regression).\n",
    "  2. Accurate estimation of logistic regression parameters requires larger amount of observation as compared to linear regression. **The rule of ten** states (without any scientific rigor) that logistic regression models requires a minimum of about 10 observations per predictor variable.\n"
