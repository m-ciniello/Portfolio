    "    - Y: integer rating from one to five\n",
    "  - DNA sequence analysis (**sequence to sequence**):\n",
    "    - X: DNA sequence\n",
    "    - Y: DNA Labels\n",
    "  - Machine translation (**sequence to sequence**):\n",
    "    - X: text sequence (in one language)\n",

    "- **Representing words**:\n",
    "    - We will now work in this course with **NLP** which stands for natural language processing. One of the challenges of NLP is how can we represent a word?\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. We need a **vocabulary** list that contains all the words in our target sets.\n",

    "            - [a ... And   ... Harry ... Potter ... Zulu]\n",
    "            - Each word will have a unique index that it can be represented with.\n",
    "            - The sorting here is in alphabetical order.\n",
    "        - Vocabulary sizes in modern applications are from 30,000 to 50,000. 100,000 is not uncommon. Some of the bigger companies use even a million.\n",
    "        - To build vocabulary list, you can read all the texts you have and get m words with the most occurrence, or search online for m most occurrent words.\n",
    "    2. Create a **one-hot encoding** sequence for each word in your dataset given the vocabulary you have created.\n",
    "        - While converting, what if we meet a word thats not in your dictionary?\n",
    "        - We can add a token in the vocabulary with name `<UNK>` which stands for unknown text and use its index for your one-hot vector.\n",

    "    - This can be solved for normal NNs by paddings with the maximum lengths but it's not a good solution.\n",
    "  - Doesn't share features learned across different positions of text/sequence.\n",

    "- After a sequence model is trained on a language model, to check what the model has learned you can apply it to sample novel sequence.\n",
    "- This essentially means we sample from the probability distribution we have created and get random new words (creating novel sequences)\n",

    "  2. We first pass a<sup>&lt;0&gt;</sup> = zeros vector, and x<sup>&lt;1&gt;</sup> = zeros vector.\n",
    "      - We pass 0 to x1 because we want the raw probability of getting any first word... So 'The' or 'This' would likely be picked randomly (assuming our trained probability distribution is solid).\n",
    "  3. Then we choose a prediction randomly from distribution obtained by y&#770;<sup>&lt;1&gt;</sup>. For example it could be \"The\".\n",
    "     - In numpy this can be implemented using: `numpy.random.choice(...)`\n",
    "     - This is the line where you get a random beginning of the sentence each time you sample run a novel sequence.\n",
    "  4. We pass the last predicted word with the calculated  a<sup>&lt;1&gt;</sup>\n",
    "  5. We keep doing 3 & 4 steps for a fixed length or until we get the `<EOS>` token.\n",
    "      - You could keep sampling (adding timesteps) until you get EOS, or you could just say you want sentences of N length (or a random length).\n",

    "- In the character-level language model, the vocabulary will contain `[a-zA-Z0-9]`, punctuation, special characters and possibly <EOS> token.\n",
    "- Character-level language model has some pros and cons compared to the word-level language model\n",
    "  - Pros:\n",
    "    1. There will be no `<UNK>` token - it can create any word.\n",
    "  - Cons:\n",
    "    1. The main disadvantage is that you end up with much longer sequences. \n",
    "    2. Character-level language models are not as good as word-level language models at capturing long range dependencies between how the the earlier parts of the sentence also affect the later part of the sentence.\n",
    "    3. Also more computationally expensive and harder to train.\n",
    "- The trend Andrew has seen in NLP is that for the most part, a word-level language model is still used, but as computers get faster there are more and more applications where people are, at least in some special cases, starting to look at more character-level models. Also, they are used in specialized applications where you might need to deal with unknown words or other vocabulary words a lot. Or they are also used in more specialized applications where you have a more specialized vocabulary."
