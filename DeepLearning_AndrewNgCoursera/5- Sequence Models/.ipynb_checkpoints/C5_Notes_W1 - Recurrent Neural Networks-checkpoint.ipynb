    "        - To build vocabulary list, you can read all the texts you have and get m words with the most occurrence, or search online for m most occurrent words.\n",

    "Given the sentence **\"Cats average 15 hours of sleep a day. `<EOS>`\"** (ignore the period, though you can make it a token if you like)\n",
    "  - In training time we will use the following network.\n",
    "  - a0 will be set to a vector of zero. \n",
    "  - a1 output is list of probabilities with V probas (its the softmax output)... and we want y1 to be the first word in the training sentence\n",
    "  - So each step in the RNN will look at some set of preceeding words, and predict the probability distribution of getting the current word... YOU MULTIPLE ALL OF THESE PROBAILITIES TO GET THE SENTENCE PROBABILITY WOOOOT!\n",
    "  - **So the RNN learns to predict one word at a time going from left to right**\n",

    "    - `i`  is for all elements in the corpus, `t` - for all timesteps.\n",
    "- To use this model:\n",
    "  1.  For predicting the chance of **next word**, we feed the sentence to the RNN and then get the final y<sup>&lt; t &gt;</sup> hot vector and sort it by maximum probability.\n",
    "  2.  For taking the **probability of a sentence**, we compute this:\n",
    "      - p(y<sup>&lt; 1 &gt;</sup>, y<sup>&lt; 2 &gt;</sup>, y<sup>&lt; 3 &gt;</sup>) = p(y<sup>&lt; 1 &gt;</sup>) \\* p(y<sup>&lt; 2 &gt;</sup> | y<sup>&lt; 1 &gt;</sup>) \\* p(y<sup>&lt; 3 &gt;</sup> | y<sup>&lt; 1 &gt;</sup>, y<sup>&lt; 2 &gt;</sup>)\n",

    "  - Cons:\n",
    "    1. The main disadvantage is that you end up with much longer sequences. \n",
    "    2. Character-level language models are not as good as word-level language models at capturing long range dependencies between how the the earlier parts of the sentence also affect the later part of the sentence.\n",
    "    3. Also more computationally expensive and harder to train.\n",
    "- The trend Andrew has seen in NLP is that for the most part, a word-level language model is still used, but as computers get faster there are more and more applications where people are, at least in some special cases, starting to look at more character-level models. Also, they are used in specialized applications where you might need to deal with unknown words or other vocabulary words a lot. Or they are also used in more specialized applications where you have a more specialized vocabulary."

    "### Now lets look inside the black box!\n",
    "The basic idea is that the network can learn what to store in the long-term state, what to throw away, and wat to read from it. As the long-term state c(t-1) traverses the network from left to right:\n",
    "- it first goes through a **forget gate**, dropping some memories\n",

    "### Memory and LTSM gates\n",

    "First, the **current input vector x(t)** and the previous **short-term state h(t–1)** are fed to four different fully connected layers. They all serve a different purpose:\n",
    "- **The main layer is the one that outputs g(t):** \n",
    "    - It has the usual role of analyzing the current inputs x(t) and the previous (short-term) state h(t–1). In a basic cell, there is nothing else than this layer, and **its output goes straight out to y(t) and h(t).** \n",
    "    - In contrast, in an LSTM cell this layer’s output DOES NOT go straight out, but instead it is partially stored in the long-term state.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **The three other layers are gate controllers.** \n",
    "    - Since they use the logistic activation function, **their outputs range from 0 to 1.** \n",
    "    - As you can see, **their outputs are fed to element-wise multiplication operations,** so if they output 0s, they close the gate, and if they output 1s, they open it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **The forget gate (controlled by f(t))** controls which parts of the long-term state should be erased.\n",
    "    2. **The input gate (controlled by i(t))** controls which parts of g(t) should be added to the long-term state (this is why we said it was only “partially stored”).\n",
    "    3. **The output gate (controlled by o(t))** controls which parts of the long-term state should be read and output at this time step (both to h(t)) and y(t).\n",
