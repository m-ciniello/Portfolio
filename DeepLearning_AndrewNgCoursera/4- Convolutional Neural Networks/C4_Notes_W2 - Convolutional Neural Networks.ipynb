    "  - Lets say you have a cat classification problem which contains 3 classes Tigger, Misty and neither.\n",
    "  - You don't have much a lot of data to train a NN on these images.\n",
    "  - Andrew recommends to go online and download a good NN with its weights, remove the softmax activation layer and put your own one and make the network learn only the new layer while other layer weights are fixed/frozen.\n",
    "  - Frameworks have options to make the parameters frozen in some layers using `trainable = 0` or `freeze = 0`\n",
    "  - One of the tricks that can speed up your training, is to run the pretrained NN without final softmax layer and get an intermediate representation of your images and save them to disk. And then use these representation to a shallow NN network. This can save you the time needed to run an image through all the layers.\n",
    "    - Its like converting your images into vectors.\n",
    "- Another example:\n",
    "  - What if in the last example you have a lot of pictures for your cats.\n",
    "  - One thing you can do is to freeze few layers from the beginning of the pretrained network and learn the other weights in the network.\n",
    "  - Some other idea is to throw away the layers that aren't frozen and put your own layers there.\n",
    "- Another example:\n",
    "  - If you have enough data, you can fine tune all the layers in your pretrained network but don't random initialize the parameters, leave the learned parameters as it is and learn from there. \n",

    "# Data Augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- If data is increased, your deep NN will perform better. Data augmentation is one of the techniques that deep learning uses to increase the performance of deep NN.\n",
    "- The majority of computer vision applications needs more data right now.\n",
    "- Some data augmentation methods that are used for computer vision tasks includes:\n",
    "  - Mirroring.\n",
    "  - Random cropping.\n",
    "    - The issue with this technique is that you might take a wrong crop.\n",
    "    - The solution is to make your crops big enough.\n",
    "  - Rotation.\n",
    "  - Shearing.\n",
    "  - Local warping.\n",
    "  - Color shifting.\n",
    "    - For example, we add to R, G, and B some distortions that will make the image identified as the same for the human but is different for the computer.\n",
    "    - In practice the added value are pulled from some probability distribution and these shifts are some small.\n",
    "    - Makes your algorithm more robust in changing colors in images. \n",
    "    - There are an algorithm which is called ***PCA color augmentation*** that decides the shifts needed automatically.\n",
    "- Implementing distortions during training:\n",
    "  - You can use a different CPU thread to make you a distorted mini batches while you are training your NN.\n",
    "- Data Augmentation has also some hyperparameters. A good place to start is to find an open source data augmentation implementation and then use it or fine tune these hyperparameters."

    "- For a specific problem we may have a little data for it or a lots of data.\n",
    "- Speech recognition problems for example has a big amount of data, while image recognition has a medium amount of data and the object detection has a small amount of data nowadays.\n",
    "- If your problem has a large amount of data, researchers are tend to use:\n",
    "  - Simpler algorithms.\n",
    "  - Less hand engineering.\n",
    "- If you don't have that much data people tend to try more hand engineering for the problem \"Hacks\". Like choosing a more complex NN architecture.\n",
    "- Because we haven't got that much data in a lot of computer vision problems, it relies a lot on hand engineering.\n",
    "- We will see in the next chapter that because the object detection has less data, a more complex NN architectures will be presented.\n",
    "- Tips for doing well on benchmarks/winning competitions:\n",
    "  - Ensembling.\n",
    "    - Train several networks independently and average their outputs. Merging down some classifiers.\n",
    "    - After you decide the best architecture for your problem, initialize some of that randomly and train them independently.\n",
    "    - This can give you a push by 2%\n",
    "    - But this will slow down your production by the number of the ensembles. Also it takes more memory as it saves all the models in the memory.\n",
    "    - People use this in competitions but few uses this in a real production.\n",
    "  - Multi-crop at test time.\n",
    "    - Run classifier on multiple versions of test versions and average results.\n",
    "    - There is a technique called 10 crops that uses this.\n",
    "    - This can give you a better result in the production.\n",
    "- Use open source code\n",
    "  - Use architectures of networks published in the literature.\n",
    "  - Use open source implementations if possible.\n",
    "  - Use pretrained models and fine-tune on your dataset."
