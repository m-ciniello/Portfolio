    "# 1. Recap\n",
    "In the last mission, we learned how to use limits to calculate the point a function approaches when the input value approaches a specific value. We applied this technique to calculate the slope of the tangent line at a specific point on our nonlinear function: y=−(x2)+3x−1. If you recall from the first mission in this course, we're interested in determining the highest point on this curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever hiked a mountain before, you'll be familiar with how the trail slopes up until you reach the peak. Once you're at the peak, however, all of the paths back down slope downwards. Understanding how the slope varies throughout a curve provides a useful lens for determining the maximum point on a curve."

    "# 2. Introduction to Derivitaves\n",
    "When x is less than 1.5, the slope is positive. As x approaches 1.5 from the left side, the slope decreases and approaches 0. At x=1.5, the slope of the tangent line is exactly 0. When we increased x past 1.5 the slope of the tangent line becomes increasingly negative. **The highest point on our curve acts as a kind of transition point from positive slope to negative slope. So the highest point has a slope of 0.** We'll discuss this in further detail later in this mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](slope_pic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**By plotting the slopes at many different x values (the plot below), we can tell that they follow a straight line. This line can be described as its own function, and is known as the *derivative*.** A function's derivative can tell us the slope of the tangent line for any x value along the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](slope1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've been solving for the slope at specific points by plugging in the specific x value into the slope equation as expressed as a limit. To find the general function that describes the slope at any point, we need to solve the limit using the original variable instead of replacing with a specific x value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first start by rewriting the slope equation to the more common form. Instead of using x1 and x2 in the slope equation, let's use x and x+h. This version of the slope equation is how most textbooks and resources refer to slope:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this form, h represents the distance between the 2 points: x and x+h. The slope is the value the limit approaches as h approaches 0. In the next screen, we'll dive into finding the derivative function.\n",

    "\n",
    "The process of finding a function's derivative is known as differentiation. Instead of selecting a specific x value, we'll leave x where it is and expand the equation to solve for the derivative. Since $f(x) = -(x)^2 + 3x - 1$, this works out to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(-(x + h)^2 + 3(x + h) - 1) - (-(x)^2 + 3x - 1)}{h}$\n",

    "If we continue expanding the equation to individual terms only, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{-x^2 - 2xh - h^2 +3x + 3h - 1 + x^2 - 3x + 1}{h}$\n",
    "\n",
    "After cancelling out opposing terms, we get the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{-2xh - h^2 + 3h}{h}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we factor our the h that all of the terms in the numerator share, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h(-2x - h + 3)}{h}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we cancel the h on both the numerator and the denominator, we finally get a defined limit.\n",

    "\n",
    "*MIKE'S SIDE NOTE: Ok, so a derivitave is essentially plotting the value of tangent slopes on the y axis, and the corresponding x values of the equation on the x axis. Again, the tangent slopes of an equation on the y axis, and correspoding x value on the x axis. The reason we want the limit as h approaches 0 is because when h is 0 (in x + h), the two points in the slope equation are equal (this is the point at which you want to mesure the slope to get the tangent line). So as h gets closer to 0, we get closer to the tangent slope, and thus closer to the y value of the derrivative!*\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to ask you to solve the final step using direct substitution, which we discussed in the last mission. Note that the result of this limit won't be a single value, but instead a new function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplify the equation by using direct substitution to solve the limit.\n",
    "- Use numpy.linspace() to generate 110 values from -5 to 6 and assign to x.\n",
    "- Transform x using the equation you just solved and assign to y.\n",
    "- Generate a line plot using x and y."

At a function's critical point, **the slope is either 0 or undefined**. Not all critical points act as transition points for slopes, however. The following widget visualizes the slope for $y=x^3$ and lets you explore how the slope changes before and aftere the critical point.

    "In the last screen, we observed how the slope didn't change from positive to negative at the critical point. Critical points are interesting to us in data science when they represent extreme values. Extreme values can be split into 2 categories -- minimum and maximum. As we noticed at the beginning of the mission, a critical point can be a minimum value if the slope transitions from negative to positive at that point. When the slope transitions from positive to negative at a point, it can be a maximum value. If the slope doesn't transition at a critical point, like at x=0 for y=x^3 in the last screen, then it can't be a minimum or a maximum point.\n",

At the same time, none of the values are the highest points on the curve (while one of them seems to be the lowest).\n",

    "These values are known as local extrema, since they're the lowest or highest value in the interval surrounding each point. If a critical point is the lowest point in the interval surrounding it, it's known as a relative minimum. If it's the highest point in the neighborhood, it's known as a relative maximum.\n",
