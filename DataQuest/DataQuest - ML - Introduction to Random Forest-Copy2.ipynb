While the extra training time is trivial on the data set we're working with right now, understanding this trade-off will help you when you're working with much larger data sets where the extra time could amount to hours or days!\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major advantages of random forests over single decision trees is that they tend to overfit less. Although each individual decision tree in a random forest varies widely, the average of their predictions is less sensitive to the input data than a single tree is. This is because while one tree can construct an incorrect and overfit model, the average of 100 or more trees will be more likely to hone in on the signal and ignore the noise. The signal will be the same across all of the trees, whereas each tree will hone in on the noise differently. This means that the average will discard the noise and keep the signal.\n",

    "\n",
    "While the random forest algorithm is incredibly powerful, it isn't applicable to all tasks. The main strengths of a random forest are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very accurate predictions - Random forests achieve near state-of-the-art performance on many machine learning tasks. Along with neural networks and gradient-boosted trees, they're typically one of the top-performing algorithms.\n",
    "- Resistance to overfitting - Due to their construction, random forests are fairly resistant to overfitting. We still need to set and tweak parameters like max_depth though.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main weaknesses of using a random forest are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They're difficult to interpret - Because we've averaging the results of many trees, it can be hard to figure out why a random forest is making predictions the way it is.\n",
    "- They take longer to create - Making two trees takes twice as long as making one, making three takes three times as long, and so on. Fortunately, we can exploit multicore processors to parallelize tree construction. **Scikit allows us to do this through the n_jobs parameter on RandomForestClassifier. We'll discuss parallelization in greater detail later on.**\n",
