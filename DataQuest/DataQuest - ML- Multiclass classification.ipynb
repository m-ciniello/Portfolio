    "The dataset we will be working with contains information on various cars. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, and how fast the car accelerates. Using this information we will predict the origin of the vehicle, either North America, Europe, or Asia. We can see, that unlike our previous classification datasets, we have three categories to choose from, making our task slightly more challenging.\n",

The cylinders and year columns must be converted to numeric values so we can use them to predict label origin. Even though the column year is a number, weâ€™re going to treat them like categories. **The year 71 is unlikely to relate to the year 70 in the same way those two numbers do numerically, but rather just as two different labels. In these instances, it is always safer to treat discrete values as categorical variables.**\n",

Since we have 5 different categories of cylinders, we could use 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 to represent the different categories. We can split the column into separate binary columns:\n",
