In this mission, we'll dive more deeply into relations between tables, learn about data normalization, and how we can take advantage of them to perform more complex joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll work with data on Academy Award nominations from 2001 to 2010 for just the lead and supporting acting roles. The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars, is an annual awards ceremony hosted to recognize the achievements in the film industry. There are many different awards categories and the members of the academy vote every year to decide which artist or film should get the award. The full dataset, containing data on all award categories from years 1927 to 2010, can be found here. We've cleaned and transformed the data and created academy_awards.db.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database file academy_awards.db contains 2 tables:\n",

    "    - Actor -- Supporting Role.\n",
    "    - Actress -- Leading Role.\n",

    "- won: Boolean field, if the actor or actress won the award (either 0 or 1).\n",

You'll notice that among the nominees for each award, there was 1 nominee with a value of 1 for won and 4 nominees with a value of 0 for won. You may have also noticed that the movie The King's Speech shows up twice. This is because separate actors were nominated for different roles in the same movie.\n",

    "A one-to-many relation exists whenever many rows in one table need to relate to one row in the other table. The relation between ceremonies and nominations is a one-to-many relation since many rows in the nominations table can be linked to an individual row in the ceremonies table. A row in the ceremonies table contains no reference to the nominations table. However, many rows in the nominations table contain a reference to the ceremonies table using the ceremony_id foreign key.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some other examples of one-to-many relations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a car insurance policy can have multiple people on it, but each person can only belong to one policy.\n",

    "# 4. Querying a normalized database\n",
    "\n",
    "As with many things in software development, there is a tradeoff to database normalization. We need to write longer queries sometimes and use joins more often to grab information from multiple tables. Many companies have databases with hundreds or thousands of tables with many relations in between, so this can get complicated quickly! As you become more familiar with querying normalized databases, you'll be able to overcome the added complexity much more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a query that involves 2 tables that are in a one-to-many relation, you need to join on the foreign key column that the \"many\" side uses to reference the \"one\" side. When using the WHERE statement to express filtering criteria, we can use columns from both tables. For example, to return all of the movies that won an award in 2010, we'd need to write the following query:\n",

    "    SELECT movie FROM nominations \n",
    "    INNER JOIN ceremonies\n",

    "\n",
    "When joining 2 tables, you can be more explicit about which columns you want returned from which tables using dot notation -- e.g. nominations.movie. In the following query, we modified the earlier query to select the year and host columns from ceremonies and the movie and nominee columns from nominations:\n",

    "If we wanted to extend our analysis to study how Academy Awards affect a nominee's career, we'd need to first add more data on which movies each actor starred in. We need a way to represent the relation between actors and movies. Our first instinct might be to use a movies table, an actors table, and specify a one-to-many relationship between them. The movies table could contain an actor_id field that acts as a foreign key reference to the id column from the actors table.\n",

    "If we think that we'll almost always be accessing the movies and actors names when we're querying the nominations table, then forcing the user to do multiple joins to get the relevant information is quite cumbersome. In addition, we know that once an awards ceremony has finished, the movies and nominees are not going to change. This means that another benefit of normalization, easy updating and editing of related values, probably won't be realized.\n",

    "When we represented the year and host columns in a separate table from the nominations table, we made the assumption that we don't always need to access both columns every single time when querying the nominations table. We preferred having less data redundancy and writing a join when we needed to.\n",

    "**Lastly, it's important to remember that the schema isn't set in stone. In many cases, it's best to start out with a denormalized representation of your data with one, or a few, giant tables. As your data grows and your use cases change, you can rethink your schema and restructure your data accordingly. When structuring your data and writing a schema, it's important to remember the tradeoffs that come with normalization.**"
