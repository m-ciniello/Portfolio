    "# 1. Introduction to the data\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've learned how to write SQL queries to interact with existing databases. In this guided project, you'll learn how to clean a CSV dataset and add it to a SQLite database. If you're new to either our guided projects or Jupyter notebook in general, you can learn more here. You can find the solutions to this guided project here.\n",

    "We'll work with data on Academy Award nominations, which can be downloaded here. The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars, is an annual awards ceremony hosted to recognize the achievements in the film industry. There are many different awards categories and the members of the academy vote every year to decide which artist or film should get the award. The awards categories have changed over the years, and you can learn more about when categories were added on Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the columns in the dataset, academy_awards.csv:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Year - the year of the awards ceremony.\n",
    "- Category - the category of award the nominee was nominated for.\n",
    "- Nominee - the person nominated for the award.\n",
    "- Additional Info - this column contains additional info like:\n",
    " - the movie the nominee participated in.\n",
    " - the character the nominee played (for acting awards).\n",
    "- Won? - this column contains either YES or NO depending on if the nominee won the award.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read in the dataset into a Dataframe and explore it to become more familiar with the data. Once you've cleaned the dataset, you'll use a Pandas helper method to export the data into a SQLite database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Import pandas and read the CSV file academy_awards.csv into a Dataframe using the read_csv method.\n",
    " - When reading the CSV, make sure to set the encoding to ISO-8859-1 so it can be parsed properly.\n",
    "- Start exploring the data in Pandas and look for data quality issues.\n",
    " - Use the head method to explore the first few rows in the Dataframe.\n",
    " - There are 6 unnamed columns at the end. Use the value_counts method to explore if any of them have valid values that we need.\n",
    " - You'll notice that the Additional Info column contains a few different formatting styles. Start brainstorming ways to clean this column up."

    "Since SQLite uses the integers 0 and 1 to represent Boolean values, convert the Won? column to reflect this. Also rename the Won? column to Won so that it's consistent with the other column names. Finally, get rid of the 6 extra, unnamed columns, since they contain only null values in our filtered Dataframe nominations.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Use the Series method map to replace all NO values with 0 and all YES values with 1.\n",
    " - Select the Won? column from nominations.\n",
    " - Then create a dictionary where each key is a value we want to replace and each value is the corresponding replacement value.\n",
    "      - The following dictionary replace_dict = { True: 1, False: 0 } would replace all True values with 1 and all False values with 0.\n",
    " - Call the map function on the Series object and pass in the dictionary you created.\n",
    " - Finally, reassign the new Series object to the Won? column in nominations.\n",
    "- Create a new column Won that contains the values from the Won? column.\n",
    " - Select the Won? column and assign it to the Won column. Both columns should be in the Dataframe still.\n",
    "- Use the drop method to remove the extraneous columns.\n",

    "Now that our Dataframe is cleaned up, let's write these records to a SQL database. We can use the Pandas Dataframe method to_sql to create a new table in a database we specify. This method has 2 required parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- name - string corresponding to the name of the table we want created. The rows from our Dataframe will be added to this table after it's created.\n",
    "- conn: the Connection instance representing the database we want to add to.\n",
    "Behind the scenes, Pandas creates a table and uses the first parameter to name it. Pandas uses the data types of each of the columns in the Dataframe to create a SQLite schema for this table. Since SQLite uses integer values to represent Booleans, it was important to convert the Won column to the integer values 0 and 1. We also converted the Year column to the integer data type, so that this column will have the appropriate type in our table. Here's the mapping for our columns from the Pandas data type to the SQLite data type:\n",

    "\n",
    "After creating the table, Pandas creates a large INSERT query and runs it to insert the values into the table. We can customize the behavior of the to_sql method using its parameters. For example, if we wanted to append rows to an existing SQLite table instead of creating a new one, we can set the if_exists parameter to \"append\". By default, if_exists is set to \"fail\" and no rows will be inserted if we specify a table name that already exists. If we're inserting a large number of records into SQLite and we want to break up the inserting of records into chunks, we can use the chunksize parameter to set the number of rows we want inserted each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're creating a database from scratch, we need to create a database file first so we can connect to it and export our data. To create a new database file, we use the sqlite3 library to connect to a file path that doesn't exist yet. If Python can't find the file we specified, it will create it for us and treat it as a SQLite database file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQLite doesn't have a special file format and you can use any file extension you'd like when creating a SQLite database. We generally use the .db extension, which isn't a file extension that's generally used for other applications.**\n",

    "In this guided project, you used Pandas to clean a CSV dataset and export it to a SQLite database. As a data scientist, it's important to learn many tools and how to use them together to accomplish what you need to. As you do more guided projects, you'll become more familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of each tool. For example, you probably have noticed that data cleaning is much easier in Pandas than in SQL.\n",

    "  - The awards categories in older ceremonies were different than the ones we have today. What relevant information should we keep from older ceremonies?\n",
    "  - What are all the different formatting styles that the Additional Info column contains. Can we use tools like regular expressions to capture these patterns and clean them up?\n",
    "    - The nominations for the Art Direction category have lengthy values for Additional Info. What information is useful and how do we extract it?\n",
    "    - Many values in Additional Info don't contain the character name the actor or actress played. Should we toss out character name altogether as we expand our data? What tradeoffs do we make by doing so?\n",
    "  - What's the best way to handle awards ceremonies that included movies from 2 years?\n",
    "    - E.g. see 1927/28 (1st) in the Year column.\n",
