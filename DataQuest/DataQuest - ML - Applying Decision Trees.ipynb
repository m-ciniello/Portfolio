    "This is known as the bias-variance tradeoff. Imagine that we take a random sample of training data and create many models. If the models' predictions for the same row are far apart from each other, we have high variance. Imagine this time that we take a random sample of the training data and create many models. If the models' predictions for the same row are close together but far from the actual value, then we have high bias.\n",

    "High bias can cause underfitting -- if a model is consistently failing to predict the correct value, it may be that it's too simple to model the data faithfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "High variance can cause overfitting. If a model varies its predictions significantly based on small changes in the input data, then it's likely fitting itself to quirks in the training data, rather than making a generalizable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call this the bias-variance tradeoff because decreasing one characteristic will usually increase the other. This is a limitation of all machine learning algorithms. If you'd like to read more about the tradeoff, check out programmer Scott Fortmann-Roe's post on this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees typically suffer from high variance. The entire structure of a decision tree can change if we make a minor alteration to its training data. By restricting the depth of the tree, we increase the bias and decrease the variance. If we restrict the depth too much, we increase bias to the point where it will underfit.\n",

It can result in a simpler model that has higher accuracy on the testing set.\n",
