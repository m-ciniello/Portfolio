    "So far in the SQL and Databases: Intermediate course, we explored how to modify existing data in a table and create our own schemas. In the Database Normalization and Relations mission, we then learned about the benefits of normalization and how to query an existing database on Academy Award nominations. In the previous guided project, we walked through how to clean and prepare the original CSV dataset on Academy Award nominations and export the data into a SQLite database as a single, denormalized table. In this guided project, we will walk through how to normalize our single table into multiple tables and how to create relations between them.\n",
