    "# 1. Intro to Databases and SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous missions, we worked with data sets stored in a single file, which was usually a CSV file. While CSV files are easy to interface with, they have a lot of limitations. It's difficult to load large CSV files into a computer's memory, which is where tools like pandas work with data. CSV files also fall short when it comes to providing security for production applications (imagine if companies like Google or Facebook used CSV files to store and access data).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, CSV files are optimized for static representation. If your data changes quickly, which is true for most technology companies, then you'll need to adopt a different method.\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is a repository designed for storing, querying, and processing data. Databases store the data we want, and expose an interface for interacting with it. Most technology companies use databases to structure the data they generate and query specific subsets of it later on in order to answer questions or make updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database systems come with administrative software for configuring settings, controlling security and access, and generating reports. They also include a language for interfacing with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we'll be focusing on a language called SQL, or Structured Query Language. We use SQL to query, update, and modify the data in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is the most common language for working with databases, and an important tool in any data professional's toolkit. While SQL is a language, it's quite different from languages like Python or R. Its creators built it specifically for querying and interacting with databases, so it won't have much of the functionality you can expect in traditional programming languages. Because SQL is a declarative language, the user focuses on expressing what he or she wants, and the computer focuses on figuring out how to perform the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into SQL syntax, we'll introduce a few database concepts so you're aware of how databases represent data, and why SQL makes it easy to work with that data."

    "# 2. Querying Databases with SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a SQL query is the primary way to interact with a database. A SQL query has to adhere to a defined structure and vocabulary that we use to specify what we want the database to do. The SQL language has a set of general statements that we combine with specific logic to express the intent of our query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most basic statement in SQL is a SELECT statement. To specify that we want to return 10 specific columns for all of the rows in a certain table, we use the SELECT keyword, along with the names of the 10 columns. We use a SELECT statement whenever we want to return specific data from the database without editing or modifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the basic syntax for the SELECT statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT [columnA, columnB, ...]\n",
    "    FROM tableName;\n",
    "    \n",
    "The SQL syntax reads more like English than a programming language like Python. The database converts our query to lower-level logic and returns the results to us. Now let's see what an actual SQL query looks like. The following query selects the Rank and Major columns from the table recent_grads, which represents the information from recent-grads.csv as a table in the database:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SELECT Rank,Major\n",
    "    FROM recent_grads;\n",
    "    \n",
    "The semicolon (;) at the end of the query is required because it specifies where the query ends. This allow us to write a query on one line, or over multiple lines."

    "# 3. Querying a SQLite Database\n",
    "We'll be working with SQLite, a lightweight database that's ideal for exploring and learning SQL. We'll explore how SQLite works under the hood in a later mission. For now, we've taken care of setting up and populating the database for our next exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing and running SQL queries in our interface is similar to writing and running Python code. Write the query in the code cell, and then click Check to execute the query against the database. SQLite returns the results as a list of lists, where each inner list represents the values in a row. If you write multiple queries in a code cell, SQLite will only display the last query's results.\n",

If we wanted to figure out which majors had more female graduates than male graduates (where ShareWomen is larger than 0.5), we would need a way to constrain the rows the query returns.\n",
