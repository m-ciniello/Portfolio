    "At the end of the last mission, we fixed a first point on our curve, drew a secant line between that first point and another second point, and observed what happened when we moved the second point closer to the first point along the curve. **The larger the interval between the 2 points on the x-axis, the more the steepness of the secant line diverged from the steepness of the curve. The closer the interval, the more the secant line started to match the steepness at the first point on the curve.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll formalize the idea of slope further and learn how to calculate the slope for nonlinear equations at any given point. As you go through the rest of this course, we strongly recommend following the math we present using pencil and paper. We'll start by introducing some mathematical notation that formalizes the observation we made at the end of the last mission. If we try to state the observation by plugging in values to the slope equation, we'll run into the division by zero problem:\n",

    "Even though the slope is undefined when x1 and x2 are equivalent, we still want to be able to state and reason about what value the slope approaches as x2 approaches x1. To do that, we need to reframe the problem as a limit. **A limit desribes the value a function approaches when the input variable to the function approaches a specific value.** In our case, the input variable is x2 and our function is $m = \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}$. The following mathematical notation formalizes the statement \"As x2 approaches 3, the slope between x1 and x2 approaches −3\" using a limit:\n",

    "# 2. Defined Vs. Undefined Limits\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 kinds of limits -- **defined limits** and **undefined limits**. As you can probably guess, the limit we looked at in the last screen was an undefined limit because plugging in 3 for x2 results in an undefined value. A defined limit can be evaluated just be substituting the value into the limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by understanding how defined limits work. Whenever the resulting value of a limit is defined at the value the input variable approaches, we say that limit is defined. In the last mission, we generated a table of values that displayed the slopes of the secant lines between closer and closer points to x1=3:\n",

    "|3.0001\t|3|\t-3.0001|\n",

    "To calculate each of these slopes, we plugged in both x1 and x2 values into the slope equation. Here's the calculation for the slope of the secant line between the points at x1=3 and x2=2.9 where $f(x) = -(x^2) + 3x - 1$:\n",

    "$m = \\frac{f(2.9) - f(3)}{2.9 - 3} = -2.9$\n",

    "$\\lim_{x_2 \\to 2.9} \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}$\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\lim_{x_2 \\to 2.9} \\frac{f(x_2) - (-1)}{x_2 - 3}$\n",
    "\n",
    "To finish solving the limit, we can use direct substition and plug in 2.9 for x2 into the limit. This is because the limit is defined at the specific value (2.9) that the input variable approaches (x2). When we can replace the input variable with the value it approaches in the limit, the problem is converted to a regular arithmetic problem:\n",
