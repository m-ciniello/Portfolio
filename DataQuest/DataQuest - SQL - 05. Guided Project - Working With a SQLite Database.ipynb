The read_sql_query function takes a SQL query string and a connection object, and returns a dataframe containing all of the rows and columns from the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "When pandas reads in columns this way, it automatically uses the column types from the original the database. Blank entries in the database (like the ones in the area_land column) will have NaN values in a dataframe, which means \"Not a Number.\" This is because pandas can't have blanks in numeric columns; it uses NaN to signify invalid or missing values instead.\n",

    "Read the facts table into pandas, and then compute the projected population for each country in 2050. Here's a rough outline of the steps you'll need to take:\n",

    "- Create a script called growth.py.\n",
    "- Read facts into a pandas dataframe using read_sql_query.\n",
    "- Filter out any rows that have invalid data. Look for things like the value 0 in the area_land column, which doesn't make sense.\n",
    "- Write a function that takes in a country's initial population and growth rate, and then outputs the final population. The annual population growth (expressed as a percentage) for each country is in the population_growth column, while the initial population is in the population column.\n",
    "    - The formula for compound annual population growth is:\n",
    "    - N=N0e(rt)\n",
    "    - N is the final population, N0 is the initial population, e is a constant value we can access with math.e, r is the rate of annual change, expressed as a decimal (so 1.5 percent should be .015), and t is the number of years we want to project out. Assume that you'll be starting in January 2015 and ending in January 2050, covering a period of 35 years. For example, let's say you have a country with 5000 people and a 4 percent annual growth rate. The formula would be N=5000∗e(.04∗35). Use the apply method on pandas dataframes to compute what the population will be in 2050 for each row in the data. Use the dataframe sort_values method to sort on the 2050 population in descending order. Print the 10 countries that will have the highest populations in 2050."
