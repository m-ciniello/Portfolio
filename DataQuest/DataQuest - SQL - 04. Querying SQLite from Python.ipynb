    "In past missions, we focused on exploring the SQL syntax for retrieving data from a database. In this mission, we'll explore how to interact with a SQLite database in Python so you can start to incorporate databases into your data science workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is a database that doesn't require a standalone server; it stores the entire database as a file on disk. This makes it ideal for working with larger data sets that can fit on disk but not in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas library loads the entire data set we're working with into memory, making SQLite a compelling alternative for working with data sets larger than 8 gigabytes (which is roughly the amount of memory modern computers contain). The fact that we can contain an entire database in a single file makes them easy to share; some data sets are available online as SQLite database files (using the extension .db).\n",

    "We can interact with a SQLite database in two main ways:\n",

    "- Through the SQLite Python module\n",
    "- Through the SQLite shell\n",
