    "# 1. Recap\n",
    "In the last mission, we explored how to use a simple k-nearest neighbors machine learning model that used just one feature, or attribute, of the listing to predict the rent price. We first relied on the accommodates column, which describes the number of people a living space can comfortably accommodate. Then, we switched to the bathrooms column and observed an improvement in accuracy. While these were good features to become familiar with the basics of machine learning, it's clear that using just a single feature to compare listings doesn't reflect the reality of the market. An apartment that can accommodate 4 guests in a popular part of Washington D.C. will rent for much higher than one that can accommodate 4 guests in a crime ridden area.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 ways we can tweak the model to try to improve the accuracy (decrease the RMSE during validation):\n",
    "\n",
    "- increase the number of attributes the model uses to calculate similarity when ranking the closest neighbors\n",
    "- increase k, the number of nearby neighbors the model uses when computing the prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll focus on increasing the number of attributes the model uses. When selecting more attributes to use in the model, we need to watch out for columns that don't work well with the distance equation. This includes columns containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- non-numerical values (e.g. city or state)\n",
    " - Euclidean distance equation expects numerical values\n",
    "- missing values\n",
    " - distance equation expects a value for each observation and attribute\n",
    "- non-ordinal values (e.g. latitude or longitude)\n",
    " - ranking by Euclidean distance doesn't make sense if all attributes aren't ordinal\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code screen, we've read the dc_airbnb.csv dataset from the last mission into pandas and brought over the data cleaning changes we made. Let's first look at the first row's values to identify any columns containing non-numerical or non-ordinal values. In the next screen, we'll drop those columns and then look for missing values in each of the remaining columns."

For example, the maximum_nights column has values as low as 4 and high as 1825, in the first few rows itself. If we use these 2 columns as part of a k-nearest neighbors model, these attributes could end up having an outsized effect on the distance calculations because of the largeness of the values.\n",
