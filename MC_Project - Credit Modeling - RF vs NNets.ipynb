    "**Credit Modeling:** \n",
    "\n",
    "For my final project, I will be creating a cedit model (a well known data science problem that focuses on modeling a borrower's credit risk). I'll be working with financial lending data from Lending Club. Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lending Club releases data for all of the approved and declined loan applications periodically on their website. I have used the the *approved loans dataset* which containing information on current loans, completed loans, and defaulted loans. The data also includes over 50 financial and non financial variables for each loan. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Question:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Major Steps:**\n",
    "- Step 1: Read in the Data\n",
    "- Step 2: Explore Features\n",
    "- Step 3: Target Column\n",
    "- Step 4: More Data Cleansing\n",
    "- Step 5: Dummy Variables\n",
    "- Step 6: Select and Error Metric\n",
    "- Step 7: Logistic Regression/Cross Validation\n",
    "- Step 8: Penalizing the Classifier (Balanced Penalty)\n",
    "- Step 9: Penalizing the Classifier (Custom Penalty)\n",

The general approach is to keep tweaking the model until it spits out an error metric that we are satisfied with. There are several considerations we need to keep in mind before making our selection:\n",

    "**Conservative investor vantage point:** We need to treat false positives (loans that the model predicts will be paid off but actually default) differently than false negatives (loans that the model predicts will NOT be paid off but actually are). A conservative investor would want to minimize risk, and avoid false positives as much as possible. They'd be more okay with missing out on opportunities (false negatives) than they would be with funding a risky loan (false positives).\n",

    "**Class Imbalance**: However, there are about 6 times as many loans that were paid off on time (positive case, label of 1) than those that weren't (negative case, label of 0). Imbalances can cause issues with many machine learning algorithms, where they appear to have high accuracy, but actually aren't learning from the training data. In this case, we don't want to use accuracy, and should instead use metrics that tell us the number of false positives and false negatives.\n",

    "Above is an example of a Receiver Operator Curve for our first model. It represents the tradeoff between the True Positive rate and the False Positive rate. Intuitively, if the model assumed that ALL outcomes will be one, then the True Positive rate will be 100% (as it correctly predicted all of the 1s), however the False positive rate will also be 100% (it also incorrectly identified all of the 0s.) The higher the TPR, and the lower the FPR, the better the model, and the larger the area under the curve (AUC). As we can see from the above ROC, our model has a AUC of about 56%... which is just above random, not very good!"

    "**High TPR, but also high FPR:** In our first model, our fpr and tpr are around what we'd expect if the model was predicting all ones, this is the 'class imbalance' coming into effect... and it is seriously skewing our model!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using 'class_weight=balanced' arg:** To address this issue, we will tell the classifier to penalize misclassifications of the less prevalent class more than the other class. We can do this by setting the class_weight parameter to balanced when creating the LogisticRegression instance. This tells scikit-learn to penalize the misclassification of the minority class during the training process. The penalty means that the logistic regression classifier pays more attention to correctly classifying rows where loan_status is 0. **In non-technical terms, the punishment for misclassfying a 0 becomes higher than the punishment for misclassying a 1. This lowers accuracy when loan_status is 1, but raises accuracy when loan_status is 0.**\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting the class_weight parameter to balanced, the penalty is set to be inversely proportional to the class frequencies. This would mean that for the classifier, correctly classifying a row where loan_status is 0 is 6 times more important than correctly classifying a row where loan_status is 1."

    "We significantly improved false positive rate in the second model by balancing the classes, which reduced the true positive rate. Our true positive rate is now around 67%, and our false positive rate is around 40%. **From a conservative investor's standpoint, it's reassuring that the false positive rate is lower because it means that we'll be able to do a better job at avoiding bad loans than if we funded everything. However, we'd only ever decide to fund 67% of the total loans (true positive rate), so we'd immediately reject a good amount of loans.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can try to lower the false positive rate further by assigning a harsher penalty for misclassifying the negative class. While setting class_weight to balanced will automatically set a penalty based on the number of 1s and 0s in the column, we can also set a manual penalty. In the last screen, the penalty scikit-learn imposed for misclassifying a 0 would have been around 5.89 (since there are 5.89 times as many 1s as 0s)."

    "Model 1: Logistic regression with cross validation\n",
    "- Our first model was super effective at predicting 1s (loans that would be paid off) with a 99.8% TPR. However this is largely due to the class imbalance (there are far more 1s than 0s in the data, so the model just classified pretty much everything as a 1). Indeed, this model also produced a False Positive Rate of 99%, which would result in a lot of risky loans being funded. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model 2: Logistic Regression with balanced weighting of classes\n",
    "- This model was better, as it has a lower FPR of 39%, but a lower TPR of 67%. However, this is an overall improvement from the previous model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model 3: Logistic Regression with 10:1 weighting of classes\n",
    "- Model three lowers the FPR to 9%. This means that we reject almost all of the loans that have an actual classification of 0. This is good for deterring lending to risky borrowers, however in this model we would also be rejecting a lot of good loans (the TPR is only 23%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Model 2 appears to be the best, as it seems to be in the middle ground between the TPR and FPR tradeoff. However each model may be better suited for different situations depending upon the aggressiveness of the investor."
